NSM is a linguistic theory that reduces lexicons down to a set of universal semantic primitives, or primes. Primes are ordered together to form explications, which are descriptions of semantic representations consisting solely of primes.\nYou will be given a specific word or phrase, along with one or more example passages in which it is used. Your task is to provide an explication of its meaning within the context of the passages using only NSM primes.\nYour explication in the primes must capture all implied meaning and maintain the exact performative effect of the original utterance (the audience would do, think, feel, and know the same things as a result).\nBelow is a list of the primes in English, organized by category:\nI, you, someone, people, something/thing, body, kind, part, the same, other/else/another, one, two, some, all, much/many, little/few, good, bad, big, small, think, know, want, don't want, feel, see, hear, say, words, true, do, happen, move, be (somewhere), there is, be (someone/something), (is) mine, live, die, when/time, now, before, after, a long time, a short time, for some time, moment, where/place, here, above, below, far, near, side, inside, touch (contact), not, maybe, can, because, if, very, more, like/as/way."
